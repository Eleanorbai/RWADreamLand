# Conclusion  

In conclusion, RWAs are truly becoming the bridge between TradFi and DeFi. Short term phenomena, such as rising macro interest rates, as well as long term driving motivators, such as the efficiencies and opportunities found within DeFi, are catalyzing the development of the RWA ecosystem. For the first time, real world, traditional assets such as bonds, real estate, carbon credits, etc, are being brought onto the blockchain.  

As time goes on, DeFi native protocols and TradFi institutions will continue to build out the RWA ecosystem. An increasing number of DeFi and TradFi entities appear to recognize the numerous benefits that DeFi and more specifically RWAs provide, such as tokenization, ease of distribution, and transparency.  

While the thought of a bridge between TradFi and DeFi is exciting, it should be recognized that the bridge can only be made viable through seamless legal, operational, and structural coordination between the physical and digital realms. This type of coordination requires seamless information exchange and well-defined processes in the case of fault either in DeFi or in TradFi.  

More broadly, the RWA narrative is particularly notable for the crypto space as it serves as an example between a more interconnected world. No longer is DeFi isolated from the real world and TradFi. Blockchain is increasingly having real world use cases and proving its worth as a transformative technology.
